# Bullet Time - Pygame Project
Inspiration
Our inspiration for Bullet Time came from the classic Mario game, but with a unique twist where the player takes on the role of a bullet. The goal is to dodge obstacles and collect coins to win.

# How to Play
The game is a side-scrolling adventure built using Pygame. The player controls the bullet and must avoid obstacles while collecting coins to complete the level. The game is won by collecting all the coins in a given level.

# How We Built It
We custom designed all the sprites and learned Pygame from scratch to build Bullet Time. We set up collision detection, menus, sprites, animations, player stats, and maintained proper file names and conventions throughout the development process.

# Challenges We Faced
During development, we encountered some challenges with collision detection and animation. Additionally, learning Pygame from scratch was a bit of a challenge, but we were able to overcome it.

# Accomplishments We're Proud Of
We're proud of creating a unique and engaging game that captures the nostalgia of classic games while offering a fresh and exciting gameplay experience. We also custom-designed all the sprites and learned Pygame in a short amount of time, which was an incredible accomplishment.

# What We Learned
Through the development of Bullet Time, we learned a lot about Pygame and game development in general. We learned how to set up collisions, menus, sprites, animations, player stats, and maintain proper file names and conventions.

# What's Next for Bullet Time
In the future, we plan to add more levels, enemies, and power-ups to make the game even more challenging and engaging for players. Additionally, we aim to incorporate audio to enhance the gaming experience.

# How to Run the Game
To play the game, make sure you have Pygame installed and then simply run the main.py file in a Python IDE of your choice. The game will launch and you can start playing!
